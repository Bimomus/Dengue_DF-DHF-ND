# Study Case_OmicsLite_Week 3
## Vaccine HIV
### Tools: GEO, GEO2R, R (R/Rstudio), GO (g:profiler), KEGG 
This is a project based learning (PBL) in OmicsLite about exploration explanation from one journal about HIV case in patient DF, DHF and ND
Notes:
DF = Dengue Fever; DHF = Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever; ND: Non-Dengue (normal)

# Step-by-Step GEO2R
1. Check the journal, we gonna explor (today about HIV Vaccine)
2. Check the access for GEO2R (sometimes few datasets can't be explor the dataset public, so we can't running in the R)
3. After that, check dataset, go to the website GEO2R analysis
4. In GEO2R analysis website, we can filter rows and then naming, DF and DHF as a "Patient" and ND as a "Normal"
5. Check the option analysis in taskbar (in below)
6. Choose the "Options", Usually in deafult have choosed the options. But, apply "Submitter supplied" in category platform (Because NCBI generated maybe there are some changes in datasets) and choose "yes" to apply limma.
